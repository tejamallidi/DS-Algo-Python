Graphs will have edges and nodes
1. Directed
2. Undirected
3. Weighted

Neighbor node is any node adjacent to a node and can be reachable from it.

Adjaceny List is used to represent the data of a graph

a --> c
|
|
v
b <-- e
|
|
v
d <-- f

To traverse through a grapgh we can use the following traversals
1. Depth First Search traversal
2. Breadth First Search traversal

DFS: Uses a Stack
Go in a single direction from a-->b-->d and then a-->c-->e-->b-->d

BFS: Uses a Queue
Goes to all the neighbours and do the same recursively
a-->c or a-->b to start with and go to the corresponding neighbours
